Identifying agency creation in congressional hearings.

This repository includes R code used to train a GBM model to identify congressional hearings that relate to the creation of federal government agencies. The model uses modern hearings data (1946-2017, N>90,000) as a training and test set. Applying it to older hearings data (1968-1946, N>30,000) identifies potential observations of agency creation for manual review (N=3,225).
